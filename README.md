##  Project Overview

This project implements a real-time SPH-based fluid simulation capable of modelling **multi-phase fluids** (e.g. oil and water) using compute shaders in Unity. It balances **computational efficiency** with **visual realism**, targeting interactive applications like games and virtual environments.

> Built as part of the Honours Dissertation for the BSc (Hons) Games Development at Edinburgh Napier University.

## Features

-  Multi-phase SPH simulation (supports multiple fluid types with unique properties)
-  Surface tension and interfacial dynamics
-  GPU compute shader acceleration for real-time performance
-  Particle boundary collision and object interaction
-  Real-time visualisation with Unity shaders
-  Modular particle spawners

##  Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open in **Unity 2022.3 LTS** or later.
3. Add `SPH.cs` to a GameObject in the scene.
4. Add one or more `SpawnBox` components to define fluid sources.
5. Attach a boundary cube (or use fallback bounds).
6. Assign a material to the SPH renderer and hit *Play*.

## Known Limitations

-  High particle counts (>200k) may reduce performance on older GPUs.
-  Surface tension threshold requires tuning to avoid instability.
-  Rotating boundaries are supported but may require manual adjustment.
